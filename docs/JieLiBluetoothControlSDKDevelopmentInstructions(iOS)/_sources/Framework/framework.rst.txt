SDK Architecture
==================

1.SDK Introduction
----------------------

This SDK is developed based on the iOS CoreBluetooth framework. You can connect Bluetooth devices through iOS devices and send data to Bluetooth devices through iOS devices. The current SDK includes basic device connection, music control, device settings, file browsing, function settings, and management. This SDK is implemented based on RCSP protocol and is supported by AC69x series Bluetooth chips. This document is used to help customers carry out secondary development based on SDK and accelerate the realization of their own functional requirements. However, developers cannot change, add or delete the functions of the protocol in the device side software at will, otherwise it may lead to incompatibility between the device and the mobile client. If there is a need to modify or delete the protocol function, please contact the relevant person in charge of JieLi for evaluation.
